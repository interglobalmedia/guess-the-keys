# Guess the keys and press them!

## A fun little game made with JavaScript, Scss/CSS3, and HTML.

There is a pattern to the keys you have to press. Together they make a name or word. Can you guess what it is? Type your answer in the input provided and hit return. If you don't guess correctly, you will receive an error message. If you do, a secret phrase will be revealed!
