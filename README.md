# Guess the keys and press them

## A fun little game made with JavaScript, SCSS/CSS3, and HTML

There is a pattern to the keys you have to press. Together they make a name or word. Can you guess what it is? Type your answer in the input provided and hit return. If you don't guess correctly, you will receive an error message. If you do, a secret phrase will be revealed!

For a more detailed explanation of the game, please read my post on my **Developer Blog** entitled [Guess the keys](https://www.mariadcampbell.com/blog/guess-the-keys/). Don't worry, there is a link to bring you back to the live game on **Github gh-pages**!

As I was developing this game, it also reminded me of the importance of checking for **browser compatibility**. Not knowing how your application works on various browsers, rather all the most important ones (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE), can result in major feature breakers! I wrote about my cross browser compatibility experience while developing this game on my **Developer Blog**. The post is entitled [e.keyCode || e.which?](https://www.mariadcampbell.com/blog/e-keycode-e-which/).

Enjoy the game and let me know what you think!
